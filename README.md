# PyTorch FoldND UnfoldND ConvND Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the **PyTorch FoldND UnfoldND ConvND** repository, a Python-based implementation of n-dimensional convolution operations using PyTorch. This repository introduces a flexible and generalized approach to convolution operations beyond the native capabilities of PyTorch, enabling convolutions in arbitrary dimensions.

### Key Features

- **Arbitrary-Dimensional Convolution (`ConvND`)**: Implements convolution operations in any number of dimensions, extending beyond PyTorch's native 2D and 3D convolutions.
- **Auxiliary Classes (`FoldND` and `UnfoldND`)**: Provides `FoldND` and `UnfoldND` classes necessary for the implementation and manipulation of n-dimensional convolutions.
- **PyTorch Integration**: All classes inherit from `torch.nn.Module`, ensuring seamless integration with existing PyTorch workflows.
- **Python 3.12+**: Developed using Python version 3.12, ensuring compatibility with the latest Python features and optimizations.

**Note**: PyTorch does not offer built-in modules for n-dimensional convolutions. This repository fills that gap by providing robust and efficient implementations tailored for high-dimensional data processing.

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `tests` package, enabling straightforward test discovery and execution.

## Usage Notes

While the modules provided in this repository are built upon PyTorch's architecture and conventions, there are some key differences in their usage compared to PyTorch's native modules. Below are important considerations and guidelines for effectively utilizing the `FoldND`, `UnfoldND`, and `ConvND` classes.

### Differences from PyTorch's Native Modules

#### 1. **N-Dimensional Operations**

- **PyTorch Limitation**: PyTorch's native `torch.nn.Fold` and `torch.nn.Unfold` are limited to 2D operations.
- **ConvND Advantage**: The `FoldND` and `UnfoldND` classes extend these operations to n-dimensions, allowing for more versatile and generalized convolution processes.

#### 2. **Class Initialization Parameters**

Both `FoldND` and `UnfoldND` offer additional parameters to handle n-dimensional data effectively:

- **`kernel_position` (for `FoldND`)**:
  - **`"last"` (default)**: Expects input dimensions in the order `(*batch_dims, *conv_output_dims, *kernel_dims)`.
  - **`"first"`**: Expects input dimensions in the order `(*batch_dims, *kernel_dims, *conv_output_dims)`.
  - **Purpose**: Provides flexibility in how input dimensions are arranged, catering to different data formats and convolution configurations.

- **`input_size` and `output_size`**:
  - **Purpose**: Allow pre-calculations during initialization, potentially accelerating the `forward` method by avoiding repetitive computations.
  - **Usage**: When provided, these parameters should correspond to the non-batched input size (excluding batch dimensions). This ensures consistency and correctness in the unfolding and folding processes.

#### 3. **Input and Output Formats**

- **`FoldND` and `UnfoldND` Output Structures**:
  - **`FoldND`**: Reconstructs the original input from its unfolded representation, maintaining separate dimensions for kernel elements.
  - **`UnfoldND`**: Unfolds the input data into a shape that retains kernel dimensions separately, as opposed to collapsing them into a single dimension in PyTorch's native `Unfold`.

- **Comparison with PyTorch**:
  - **PyTorch's `Fold`**: Typically handles input in the shape `(N, C * kernel_height * kernel_width, L)`, where `L` is the number of sliding windows per convolution input.
  - **ConvND's `FoldND`**: Maintains separate kernel dimensions, resulting in an output shape of `(*batch_dims, *conv_output_dims, *kernel_dims)` for more intuitive handling in n-dimensional spaces.

#### 4. **Validation and Error Handling**

- **Utility Functions**: The `utils.py` module provides functions such as `param_check`, `fold_input_check`, and `unfold_input_check` to validate hyperparameters and input sizes, ensuring that the convolution operations are configured correctly.
- **Error Messages**: Comprehensive error handling is implemented to notify users of mismatches in input sizes or incorrect parameter configurations, enhancing the robustness of the modules.

### Example Usage

Below is a basic example demonstrating how to utilize the `ConvND` module alongside `FoldND` and `UnfoldND` for a 3D convolution operation:

```python
import torch
from src.conv import Conv
from src.fold import Fold, Unfold

# Define input dimensions: (batch_size, channels, depth, height, width)
input_tensor = torch.randn(8, 3, 30, 64, 64)

# Initialize FoldND and UnfoldND
fold = Fold(kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(1, 1, 1), padding=(1, 1, 1), kernel_position="last")
unfold = Unfold(kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(1, 1, 1), padding=(1, 1, 1))

# Apply UnfoldND to the input tensor
unfolded = unfold(input_tensor)

# Initialize ConvND
conv = Conv(input_channels=3, output_channels=2, kernel_size=(3, 3, 3), stride=(1, 1, 1), padding=(1, 1, 1))

# Perform convolution
output = conv(unfolded)

# Apply FoldND to reconstruct the output
folded_output = fold(output)
```

## Installation

To get started with the ConvND repository, follow these steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MiguelMontesLorenzo/FoldND-UnfoldND-ConvND.git
   cd FoldND-UnfoldND-ConvND
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     py -3.12 -m venv .venv
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     python3.12 venv .venv
     ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   - **Windows:**

     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **macOS/Linux:**

     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running Benchmarks

To evaluate the performance of the custom n-dimensional convolution against PyTorch's native convolution functions, execute the `benchmark.conv` submodule:

```bash
python -m benchmarks.conv
```

This will output the execution times and performance ratios for both 2D and 3D convolution operations.

## Testing

Ensure that all modules are functioning correctly by running the test suites using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest .
```
